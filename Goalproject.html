	<h2 class="ha"> Goal of the project </h2>
	<p class="firstparagraph"> This has one major goal : create a web GIS. This web GIS doesn't need to be huge in term of content and commands, but it must at least use several basic commands. From the technical point of view, it comes out 3 technical goals: </p>

	<ul>
		<li> How to create a website. </li>
		<li> How to create an interactive map. </li>
		<li> How to link the website, the map and the data collected from the surveys. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<div>
		<h4 class="hb"> How to create a website: </h4>
		<p class="firstparagraph"> It depends on the following choice: if we decide to take an existing model available and modify only the features that have to be changed or if we start from skratch. This second method is longer than the first one but at least we can learn the synthax by ourself (we choosed this option). So we have to understand how classes can be built, how to build an organized structure of our website and how to design the website without copying an existing one and make it clear and nice to use, regarding the quantity of features implemented. </p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div>
		<h4 class="hb"> How to create an interactive map: </h4>
		<p class="firstparagraph"> This part have been seen during the practices. The majority of the features comes from the command we saw during the lessons. Indeed, creating the map is complicated instead of the website. Therefore, the map is a copy of what we saw and we didn't add other functionalities except one. It4s the exaxt opposite of what we did for the website. The features of the map are background maps and ths datas collected on the field. </p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div>
		<h4 class="hb"> How to link website, interactive map and data: </h4>
		<p class="firstparagraph"> This part is the final product that combines the website and the map. Once the map and the website are ready, we just had to put them linked using the right hyperlinks. Moreover we had to think about the general design of the webpage which welcome the map in order to make it nicer to see and use. </p>
